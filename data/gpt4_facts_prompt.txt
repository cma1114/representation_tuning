I'm doing a research project and need a bunch of "factual" statements about the world that are either true or false. They should be fairly short (one sentence), and they should reflect common knowledge. Example true statements are: "The Earth's atmosphere protects us from harmful radiation from the sun.", "Cacti store water in their stems.", and "Sharks are sea creatures that have a reputation for being dangerous.". Example false statements are: "Oxygen is harmful to human breathing.", "The coldest place on Earth is the equator.", and "The fastest bird in the world is the penguin.". Please output 10 true and 10 false statements like that, along with their labels.
